### Explanation of Bad Design

1. **Absence of Proxy Pattern:**
   - The `MedicalRecord` class contains sensitive patient data that should not be directly accessible. There should be a `MedicalRecordProxy` that controls access, ensuring that only authorized personnel (e.g., doctors) can view or modify the records.

2. **Direct Access to Sensitive Data:**
   - The `Hospital` class directly accesses `MedicalRecord`, leading to potential security and privacy issues. There's no check or control over who can access these records, which could lead to data breaches.

3. **Misuse of Inheritance:**
   - The `Hospital` class still incorrectly inherits from `Doctor`, which should be a clear case for using composition instead.
